# Rust support for Visual Studio Code

[![](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/rust-lang.rust.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang-nursery/rls-vscode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rust-lang-nursery/rls-vscode)

Adds language support for Rust to Visual Studio Code. Supports:

* code completion
* jump to definition, peek definition, find all references, symbol search
* types and documentation on hover
* code formatting
* refactoring (rename, deglob)
* error squiggles and apply suggestions from errors
* snippets
* build tasks

Rust support is powered by the [Rust Language Server](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls)
(RLS). If you don't have it installed, the extension will install the it for you.

This extension is built and maintained by the RLS team, part of the
[Rust Developer Tools team](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html#Dev-tools-team).
It is the reference client implementation for the RLS. Our focus is on providing
a stable, high quality extension that makes best use of the RLS. We aim to
support as many features as possible, but our priority is supporting the
essential features as well as possible.

For support, please file an [issue on the repo](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls-vscode/issues/new)
or talk to us in #rust-dev-tools on IRC ([Mozilla servers](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)).
There is also some [troubleshooting and debugging](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls/blob/master/debugging.md) advice.

Contributing code, tests, documentation, and bug reports is appreciated! For
more details on building and debugging, etc., see [contributing.md](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls-vscode/blob/master/contributing.md).


## Quick start

* Install [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/) (Rust toolchain manager).
* Install this extension from [the VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust)
  (or by entering `ext install rust` at the command palette).
* (Skip this step if you already have Rust projects that you'd like to work on.)
  Create a new Rust project by following [these instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-02-hello-world.html#creating-a-project-with-cargo).
* Open a Rust project (`File > Open Folder...`). Open the folder for the whole
  project (i.e., the folder containing 'Cargo.toml'), not the 'src' folder.
* You'll be prompted to install the RLS. Once installed, the RLS should start
  building your project.


## Configuration

This extension provides some options into VSCode's configuration settings. These
options have names which start with `rust.`. You can find the settings under
`File > Preferences > Settings`, they all have Intellisense help.

Some highlights:

* `rust.show_warnings` - set to false to silence warnings in the editor.
* `rust.build_lib` - if you have both a binary and library in your crate, set to
  true to build the library.
* `rust.build_bin` - if you have multiple binaries, you can specify which to build
  using this option.
* `rust.cfg_test` - build and index test code (i.e., code with `#[cfg(test)]`/`#[test]`)
* `rust.workspace_mode` - experimental cargo workspace support. Note that using
  this feature will slow down builds significantly and may be broken in
  surprising and undocumented ways.


## Features

### Commands

Commands can be found in the command palette (ctrl + shift + p). We provide the
following commands:

* `Find Implementations` - Find locations of `impl` blocks for traits, structs, and enums.
  Usefull to find all structs implementing a specific trait or all traits implemented for a struct.
  Select a type when running the command.


### Snippets

Snippets are code templates which expand into common boilerplate. Intellisense
includes snippet names as options when you type; select one by pressing 'enter'.
You can move to the next 'hole' in the template by pressing 'tab'. We provide
the following snippets:

* `for` - a for loop
* `unimplemented`
* `unreachable`
* `println`
* `macro_rules` - declare a macro
* `if let Option` - an `if let` statement for executing code only in the `Some`
  case.
* `spawn` - spawn a thread


### Tasks

The plugin provides tasks for building, running, and testing using the relevant
cargo commands. You can build using `ctrl + shift + b`. Access other tasks via
`Run tasks` in the command palette.

The plugin writes these into `tasks.json`. The plugin will not overwrite
existing tasks, so you can customise these tasks. To refresh back to the
defaults, delete `tasks.json` and restart VSCode.


## Format on save

To enable formatting on save, you need to set the `editor.formatOnSave` setting
to `true`. Find it under `File > Preferences > Settings`.


## Requirements

* [Rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/),
* A Rust toolchain (the extension will configure this for you, with
  permission),
* RLS (currently `rls-preview`), `rust-src`, and `rust-analysis` components (the
  extension will install these for you, with permission).


## Implementation

This extension almost exclusively uses the RLS for its feature support (syntax
highlighting, snippets, and build tasks are provided client-side). The RLS uses
the Rust compiler (rustc) to get data about Rust programs. It uses Cargo to
manage building. Both Cargo and rustc are run in-process by the RLS. Formatting
and code completion are provided by rustfmt and Racer, again both of these are
run in-process by the RLS.
